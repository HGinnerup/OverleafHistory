# Add History navigation in Overleaf
Enables back- and forward navigation of opened documents in Overleaf.

Clicking backward or forward in the browser then navigates between the documents you have been in, as if they were different pages.

Also allows you to share a link, to an exact file, with collaborators who also have this extension.
